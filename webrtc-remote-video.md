# WebRTC Access to Video Cameras on WebXR Devices

 Extending WebRTC to support access to cameras on XR device sessions, and streaming/recording of video from XR devices. One goal of this approach is to avoid duplicating functionality across Web APIs (e.g., keep video device access in one place).  The core scenario here is "a worker wants to allow an expert to see what they are seeing, and overlay augmentations in their view." This scenario applies to enterprise scenarios as well as consumer apps. For consumers, this is "home owner wants to show Home Depot consultant something, get guidance and order parts for repair". This work will likely need to be done over in the WebRTC WG, as they work on the next version of WebRTC, but we should track it here in a document with relevant pointers to issues and capabilities.
