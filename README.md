# Computer vision for XR


This is a feature repo (as defined in the proposals process) that has been created for exploring computer vision APIs for XR.

The conversation that led to the creation of this repo can be found in [Proposals Issues #4](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/issues/4).

Blair MacIntyre (@blairmacintyre) is coordinating the creation of the initial explainers.
