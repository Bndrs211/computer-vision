# Native Computer VisionÂ in Browser

Exposing native, cross platform CV algorithms. The browser can expose entire algorithms running on the camera video, as suggested by the [shape-detection api proposal](https://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api/).  We could start with very basic capabilities (like detecting barcodes in 3D, images, perhaps faces). Some of the specific algorithms could be optional, but it would be nice if there were very straightforward things (like barcodes, discussed in the shape-detection api) that could be implemented everywhere. If video frames are available inside the web page, it may be possible to polyfill them with WASM implementations.  Developers and users would benefit strongly from having some common capabilities that are implemented natively when possible (e.g., using ARKit for image detection on iOS), and having an agreed upon approach for exposing platform-specific capabilities that might be hard to implement in WASM (like ARKit/ARCore's more advanced features).
